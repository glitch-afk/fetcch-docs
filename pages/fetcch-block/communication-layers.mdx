# Communication Layers

### [Layer Zero](https://layerzero.network/)

- An omnichain interoperability protocol called LayerZero is intended for quick message transmission between chains. Delivering messages authentically and reliably is ensured by LayerZero, and trustlessness can be customized.

### [Axelar](https://axelar.network/)

- For Web3, Axelar offers safe cross-chain communication. Delegated proof-of-stake is the foundation of Axelar network security; a permissionless, dynamic validator set applies a consensus method comparable to the networks Axelar connects.
