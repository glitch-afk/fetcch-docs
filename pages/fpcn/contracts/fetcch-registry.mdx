# Fetcch Registry

**Fetcch Registry** contract is responsible for providing unique namespaces for providers. Providers will acquire namespaces by sending this data

```json copy
{
  "metadata": "",
  "metadataType": "",
  "owner": "",
  "name": "",
  "logo": ""
}
```

On successful registration this contract deploys a new Provider Registry contract for providers where identities can be registered and modified.
