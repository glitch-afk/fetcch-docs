# Identities

The Fetcch Identities must ensure that users

- own their identity
- can transact between 2 or more identities or entities on the blockchain
- are quick and easy to setup
- default.address can be changed without losing ownership of identity

Identity namespace is unique for each provider on the network, so a user can own `satyam@metamask` and another user can own `satyam@phantom`, both will be considered different and will not interfere with each other.

Fetcch achieves this by having a separate identity namespace for each provider called **Provider Registry**. This is a smart contract on ethereum which issues ids to users, these ids will be alphanumeric ([A-Z a-z 0-9]).

Identities metadata is stored on a decentralized storage solution and subsequently stored on **Provider Registry** alongside

*On Chain Identities*

With `merkleRoot` anybody can verify if the data on `pid` (or as we call it **Proof of ID**) is in the correct format, contains a valid signature, and is complementary to previous state of the ID (if updated)

Fetcch Identities are purely decentralized, secure, and ownership-enabled because we use signatures at every step of the process and generate cryprographic proofs for easier verification by anyone.

If `default.address` is hacked, then to recover ID, a user has to get 2/3 signatures of `others` addresses, with this they can change `default.address` and gain back access to their ID OR else `default.address` can set a recovery address which can be multisig or a friend, and that recovery address can update `default.address` in case of a hack.
