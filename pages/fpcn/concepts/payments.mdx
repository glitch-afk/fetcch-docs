# Payments

FPCN simplifies payments for degens, everyday users, and your grandmother too. We do this by enabling transactional communication between 2 or more FPCN IDs.

FPCN IDs are connected to various addresses from various blockchains and this helps in cross-chain transactions.

FPCN supports **3 types of transaction**

- P2P Transaction
    - Cross Chain
    - Same Chain
- Payment Request Transaction
    - Cross Chain
    - Same Chain
- Cross Chain Contract Execution

#### P2P Transaction

*P2P Same Chain Transaction*

When an ID sends some token to another ID, it is constituted as a P2P Transaction.

P2P transactions can either be the same chain or cross-chain depending on addresses used from ID.

A payer can choose which chain and token to use and the recipient will receive it either on their `default.address` or if enabled `forcedSameChainPayment`, protocol chooses any other address connected to the ID which has the same chain as the payer.

Cross-chain transactions are fulfilled using bridges in between, so on the frontend, `satyam@metamask` is paying `ray@phantom` but in reality `0x312312...` is paying `5fwerfwecn...` in USDC from Ethereum to Solana using XXX Bridge.

#### Payment Request Transaction

A dApp can send a payment request to any ID from FPCN which that ID can fulfill asynchronously, this can either be a same-chain or cross-chain payment.

A Payment request can enable dApps to receive payments from users on a subscription basis or it can be used in a single-click checkout system.

The payment request is of format
```json copy
{
    "payee": "satyam@metamask",
    "payer": "ray@phantom",
    "token": "0xeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee",
    "chain": "2", // fetcch chain id
    "amount": "1000000", // in smallest denomination
    "message": "Payment for your yeezy sneakers",
    "label": "Yeezy#7813",
    "data": "", // if contract call
    
    // added after resolving payment request
    "transactionHash": "0xa66addcaf87f6f3135c982296eda74af4bb82cf67ec84065833bdff160943c44",
    "dstTransactionHash": "", // if cross chain transaction
    "fromChain": "2",
    "fromToken": "0x8f7116ca03aeb48547d0e2edd3faa73bfb232538"
}
```

A Payment Request can be dApp to Peer or dApp to dApp or Peer to Peer. It can also be either a simple token transfer or a complex transaction, it can be a cross-chain contract or same chain.

#### Cross-Chain Contract Execution

*Cross Chain Contract Execution Flow*

Cross Chain Contract Execution helps IDs to interact with smart contracts on a blockchain without requiring to have tokens or gas on that chain.

For ex. a user on Solana can LP into uniswap pools without touch bridges or an ethereum user posts on a lens from their polygon wallet without requiring a polygon token or interacting with a bridge!

In CCCE, a user uses dApp and initiates a transaction, it will be a smart contract call, Wallet will prompt which chain to use, and if it's different, wallet signs a message from the user confirming that they are ready for this transaction. ID's tokens are swapped using FPCN and the contract is called dApp's chain.

> ðŸ’¡FPCN will also support IDs for dApps in near future and that will simplify this process by a lot!
