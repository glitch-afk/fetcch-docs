# Data Sources

Data sources are storage solutions where a provider can decide to store, it can be but is not limited to

- [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech/)
- [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/)

Metadata is stored on these storage solutions and anchored on ethereum or any other blockchain.

Right now, we only support ethereum for anchoring metadata as we are working on building a more robust and trustless network, we will continue to add support for more and more blockchains in the future!
