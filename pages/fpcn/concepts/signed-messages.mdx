# Signed Messages

**FPCN** supports almost all of the major blockchains and many blockchains have different signing algorithms, we support verification of all of those algorithms, and signatures should be in the format

```json copy
{
  "id": "satyam@fetcch",
  "message": {
    // will be stringified id
  },
  "signature": {
    "signature": "0x7be6ec54af3921ead614ef56a7f106d6fc3215e2c9970bf25b8f4701383942723a5d34bb06f6fb3c28a3216cff45f5789ee0988ec759c6dc554b370721a213331b",
    "type": "ecdsa",
    "timestamp": "1667469738",
    "pubKey": "0x4e7f624c9f2dbc3bcf97d03e765142dd46fe1c46"
  }
}
```

This helps owners retain ownership of their own identities while doing off-chain stuff or relying on providers/relayers to do on/off-chain stuff.
