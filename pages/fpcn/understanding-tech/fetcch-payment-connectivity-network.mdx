### Security

We take security very seriously at Fetcch, it is our core value, to make our system secure, we encrypt every non-public data and store them on our distributed storage solution and their encrypted copies on IPFS/Arweave or any other decentralized storage solutions, then we also record them on a public blockchain, where we keep a track of each record ever updated along with their CID and merkle proof, which helps us create a very deep encrypted view of our distributed database even if we donâ€™t have access to it.
