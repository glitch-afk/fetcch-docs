# Fetcch Compute Layer (FCL)

Fetcch not only just stores data but also needs to do computations like replicating data between different layers of FSL or executing background jobs and with the introduction of **Fetcch Modules,** the need for FCL will increase exponentially and we are ready for that scale!

Any task that needs to be executed periodically or some time in the future is registered on FSL and then FCL uses that to keep track of jobs and update their statuses.

FCL consists of a distributed set of nodes that currently don’t do consensus or don’t verify the computation if that is done right or not, but we have plans in near future where we will become something like a sovereign rollup and verify the computation done by our nodes, so that we can complete our journey from **distributed to decentralized**
