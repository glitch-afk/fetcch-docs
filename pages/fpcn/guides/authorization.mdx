# Authorization

Some API routes require an authorization token and some donâ€™t need one.

### Provider Secret Key

After successfully registering, each provider gets a uniquely generated **Secret Key**, which they can use in an HTTP request for authenticating with the FSL & FCL.

Only encrypted versions of the secret key are stored on FSL, so the provider needs to keep it in a secure place, we also have options to revoke or create a new secret key

To authorize, send your secret key in headers with key `secret-key`
