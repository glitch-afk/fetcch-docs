# Authorization

Some API routes require an authorization token and some don’t need one.

There are 2 types of an authorization tokens that we support

### Provider Secret Key

After successfully registering, each provider gets a uniquely generated **Secret Key**, which they can use in an HTTP request for authenticating with the FSL & FCL.

Only encrypted versions of the secret key are stored on FSL, so the provider needs to keep it in a secure place, we also have options to revoke or create a new secret key

To authorize, send your secret key in headers with key `secret-key`

### User JWT Token

Some routes like Transaction requests may need a jwt token to authorize the user’s involvement in the process.

Once a user successfully authenticates with a dApp using ************************************************Authentication Requests************************************************, dApp receives an access token and refresh token

To authorize, dApp needs to send an access token in the header in the format `authorization: Bearer {accessToken}`
